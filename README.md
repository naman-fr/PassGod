Follow these instructions to set up and run the PassGod application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Python 3.8+**: For the backend.
-   **Node.js & npm (or yarn)**: For the web frontend.
-   **Flutter SDK**: For the mobile application.
-   **Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" and "C++ ATL" components (for Windows desktop Flutter development)**.

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content. **Replace placeholders with your actual keys.**
    ```env
    SECRET_KEY="YOUR_FERNET_SECRET_KEY" # Generate using `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`
    HIBP_API_KEY="YOUR_HIBP_API_KEY"   # Obtain from https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key
    DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./sql_app.db" # Or your PostgreSQL connection string
    ```
5.  Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
6.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (Web) Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The web application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend (Mobile) Setup

1.  Navigate to the `mobile` directory:
    ```bash
    cd mobile
    ```
2.  Ensure Flutter is configured for your desired platform (e.g., web or Windows desktop):
    ```bash
    flutter config --enable-web
    flutter config --enable-windows-desktop # If targeting Windows desktop
    ```
    If you encounter Visual Studio related errors on Windows, ensure you have "Desktop development with C++" and "C++ ATL" components installed via the Visual Studio Installer.
3.  Get Flutter dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This will launch the app on an available device or web browser.
